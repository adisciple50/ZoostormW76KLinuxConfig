# ZoostormW76KLinuxConfig
A Linux Kernel Config Built for the Zoostorm W76K.

squeezing every last drop outta the clocks. 

this is just a config file for whoever wants it. if your as nuts as i am then leave a comment in issues.

currently on linux 4 with no smp and ubuntu 15.10! XD



just copy/move the .config file into the root of a cloned/dl'd linux source folder. its a hidden file, so watch out for that. make  menuconfig or just let it rip without modding. includes most common sense modules.
